sujeto,cond,homo,ch,fluct,Instructions & Info:
Subject1,Stage1,1,F3,F3_C3,1. You have to create a DatsFile like this one for each experimental group you want to analyze. This is an example for an hypoteical experimental group of sleep.
Subject2,Stage2,5,C3,F3_P3,"2. The column ""sujeto"" is to enlist all the subjects you'll analyze. These names must coincide with the folders in DATOS_REF"
Subject3,Stage3,9,P3,F3_T3,"3. The column ""cond"" is to enlist all the conditions you'll consider for the analysis. These names must coincide with names of the folders in MC_time > MyGroup"
Subject4,StageREM,4,T3,F3_Fz,"4. The column ""homo"" is to homologate electrodes or to organize the variables in your data set. If you don't want to re-arrange the order of your variables, just fill the column 1,2,3,É, to the number of variables you have in your data set. ""homo""column and ""ch"" column must have the SAME number of rows."
Subject5,,2,Fz,F3_Cz,"5. The column ""ch"" is to name the variables in your data set. Here you can see as an example that we have named 11 electrodes."
Subject6,,6,Cz,F3_Pz,"6. The ""fluct"" column is to specify the name of the combinations of the variables that will be analized. These are the names of the non-diagonal elements in the correlation matrices ordered vertically: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), É, (last row, last column -1)"
